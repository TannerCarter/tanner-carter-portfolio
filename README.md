# Tanner Carter's Portfolio

# Version 1


# Description

My portfolio that showcases my work projects. In this challenge I had to make a portfolio that pushed me into re-imagining my site over and over again. I went through a lot of different ways in setting up my work flex boxes, and finally making it look good to the eyes of the beholder of my portfolio link.

# Tasks

- Give samples to potential employee's previous work.
- Presented my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me.
- When clicking on one of the links in the navigation the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
- When clicking on the link to the section about my work then the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the my applications.
- When presented with my first application then that application will appear larger than the other applications.
- When you click on the images of the application then you are taken to that deployed application.
- When you resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices then you are presented with a responsive layout that adapts to your viewport
